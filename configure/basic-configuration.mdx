These are basic configuration options that are available on all three services - **Web**, **Worker**, and **Jobs**. 

## Setting the Start Command

You can configure your application service to run any start command by simply editing it from the Porter Dashboard. If your application was built using a `Dockerfile`, the start command you put in here will override the
`CMD` directive that is specified in your `Dockerfile`.

## Assigning resources

From the **Resources** tab, you can assign the amount of vCPU and RAM for each of your applications. The maximum amount of resources you can assign to a single application is capped by the size of the virtual machines you are using for the underlying cluster.

This is discussed in more detail in the previous [Provisioning section](/standard/getting-started/provisioning-infrastructure#faq)

## Smart Optimization

Applications deployed on Porter are scheduled on the underlying virtual machines. Your applications will be automatically scheduled on the available virtual machines, which presents a resource optimization problem called the [bin-packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).

This optional feature called Smart Optimization ensures that the amount of resources assigned to your applications are restricted based on the amount of resources 
that are available on the virutal machines. This prevents overprovisioning of your cluster and minimizes unnecessary cost incurred on your cloud provider.
