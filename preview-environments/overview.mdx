## Getting Started

Porter offers a simple way to create preview environments for your app. When enabled, preview environments are by default created automatically for every pull request that is opened in your GitHub repository.

A unique URL is generated for each PR that you use to access your app and test changes in a production-like environment before merging. Each preview environment is created in isolation on your cluster and is destroyed once the pull request is closed or merged.

### Enabling Preview Environments

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab of your app on the Porter dashboard.
2. Click the button to **Enable** preview environments.
3. Define or override any values for your app that should be used in newly created preview environments.
4. Save your changes by clicking **Enable Previews** and committing the workflow to your GitHub repository.
