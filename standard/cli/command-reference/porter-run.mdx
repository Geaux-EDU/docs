##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

### `porter app run`[](#porter-run "Direct link to heading")

The `porter app run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard.

Running `porter app run` without specifying any flags spins up an ephemeral copy of your application 
container. This container will be deleted when your command completes, 
or when you exit your interactive shell session.

To connect to an existing running container, you can specify the `-e` flag:

```
porter app run -e [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

### Common Usage [](#porter-run-examples "Direct link to heading")
```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- bash
```
This will launch an interactive shell session through which you can run other commands, like `ls`, `ps`, etc. If `bash` isn't found on your container, you can also try `sh` for a similar result.
