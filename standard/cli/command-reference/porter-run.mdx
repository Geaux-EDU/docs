### `porter app run`[](#porter-run "Direct link to heading")

The `porter app run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]

```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard.

Running `porter app run` spins up an ephemeral copy of your application 
container. This container will be deleted when your command completes, 
or when you exit your interactive shell session.
