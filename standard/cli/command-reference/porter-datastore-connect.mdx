title: 'porter datastore connect'
---

##### Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

## Datastores[](#applications 'Direct link to heading')

`porter datastore connect` creates a secure tunnel through which you can connect to your datastore locally. For example:

```
porter datastore connect <YOUR_DATASTORE_NAME>
```

Example output from running this command:

```
Secure tunnel setup complete! While the tunnel is running, you can connect to your datastore using the following credentials:
 Host: 127.0.0.1
 Port: 8122
 Database name: postgres
 Password: <YOUR_DATASTORE_PASSWORD>

Starting proxy...[CTRL-C to exit]
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8122 -> 6379
Forwarding from [::1]:8122 -> 6379
Handling connection for 8122
```

While the secure tunnel is running, you can run the following command in a separate shell to connect to your datastore (assuming the datastore is a redis cache):

```
redis-cli -p 8122 -a <YOUR_DATASTORE_PASSWORD> --tls
```

### Port

If you would like to specify the port on which to connect to the secure tunnel, you can use the `--port` flag. By default, this is set to 8122.

```
porter datastore connect <YOUR_DATASTORE_NAME> --port <YOUR_PORT>
```
