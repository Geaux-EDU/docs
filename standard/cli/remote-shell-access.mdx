title: "Remote Shell Access to an Existing Application"
---

##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

The `porter app run` command allows users to execute a command on an application:

```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]

```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard (this can be a release either in the "Applications" or the "Jobs" tab).

## Examples[](#examples "Direct link to heading")

If you have an application called `hello-world`, and you would like to enter an interactive shell:

```
porter app run hello-world -- sh

```

To test that remote execution is working, you can run:

```
porter app run hello-world -- echo "hello world"

```
