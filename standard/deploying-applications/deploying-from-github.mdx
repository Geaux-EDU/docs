Porter lets you deploy a service directly from a Git repository. By default, services on Porter automatically update whenever there is a push to the primary branch (usually `main` or `master`) of the connected repo.

<Info>

### Prerequisites

- A repository (public or private) hosted on GitHub
- A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](/standard/getting-started/overview))

</Info>

These docs will guide you through getting your applications set up and integrated with Github:
