Porter lets you create and update applications using the CLI. By default, the CLI builds your application, pushes it to a Docker registry, and re-deploys your application on Porter. Note that these commands are used internally when you [deploy from Github](/standard/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github) or [use your own CI tools](/standard/deploying-applications/using-other-ci-tools).

This section contains the following guides:

* [Updating an Application from the CLI](/standard/deploying-applications/deploying-from-cli/updating-an-application)

For a full overview of the CLI, see the [CLI section of the docs](/standard/cli/installation).
