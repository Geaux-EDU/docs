Built for companies who want to optimize primarily for simplicity (i.e. you don't want anything to do with DevOps),
**Porter Standard** is a great way for seed-stage companies to get started quickly without worrying about infrastructure,
with a peace of mind that they can always customize their infrastructure in the future as the need arises.

If you want visibility into the underlying infrastructure and be exposed to the complexity of Kubernetes for more flexibility, please [contact us](mailto:contact@porter.run) for **Porter Enterprise**. 
Our Enterprise offering is available to companies that are using more than 40 vCPU and 80 GB RAM **at no additional cost**.

This **Getting Started** guide will show you how to deploy your first application on Porter. This guide will take under an hour to complete.
