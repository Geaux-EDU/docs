## Merging in the PR for GitHub Actions

After you first create the application, you will be asked to merge in the PR Porter has created in your repository. Porter will open the PR from a new branch called `porter-stack`.

Once you merge the PR in, this GitHub actions file will automatically build and deploy your application on pushes to the specified source branch. Consequently, all build logs should be viewed on GitHub Actions, not on the Porter dashboard.

## Viewing your Build Logs

To view the build logs of your application, navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository. Click on the most recent **Deploy to Porter** workflow to view the build logs of your application.

## Retrying a Build on Failure

When builds fail, you will have to troubleshoot the build process by directly looking at logs from GitHub actions. To retry a build, you can simply click on the **Re-run failed jobs** button after selecting the job run.

You can also trigger a rerun of this GitHub Actions from the Porter dashboard, in the **Build Settings** tab of your application.

## When a Build is Successful

When the build has completed successfully, Porter will automatically push the built artifacts into your Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and update your application with the new build.
Congratulations, you've deployed your first application on Porter! ðŸŽ‰

Now it's time to scale it.
