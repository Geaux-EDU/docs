Now that you've provisioned infrastructure in your AWS account, you can deploy your first application. In this example, we'll deploy a simple nodeJS application to verify that your cluster has been provisioned successfully.

## Launch your Application[](#launch-your-application "Direct link to heading")

On the Porter dashboard, click on **New Application**.

After you give your application a name, you will be prompted to deploy your application from a Git repository or a Docker registry.
If you already have your own CI/CD pipelines and maintain your own docker images, you can deploy directly from the Docker registry.
In this guide, we'll be deploying from the Git repository.

## Installing the Porter GitHub App

Before you can start deploying your application, you will be prompted to install the Porter GitHub app.
Once you're redirected to a GitHub authorization and installation screen, select which repositories you want to install the Porter App in.
Depending on your Github organization settings, you may need to request the installation and wait for an approval from your organization admin.
