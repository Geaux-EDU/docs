title: 'Predeploy'
---

Predeploy is run following a new build, but before the build is deployed to the cluster. This is a good place to run migrations, or to generate any files that are needed for the deploy.
For more information on pre-deploy jobs in Porter, see [Pre-deploy Jobs](/new/deploy/pre-deploy-jobs).

```yaml
predeploy:
  run: 'npm run migrate'
```
