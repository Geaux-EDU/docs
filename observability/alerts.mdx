On critical events such as Application Crash Loop, Out of Memory errors, or non-zero exit codes, Porter will alert you on Slack. 

You can set up the Slack integration from the **Integration** tab. For advanced and custom alerts, we recommend using a 3rd party addon such as Datadog, Mezmo, or New Relic that you can one-click install from the Integrations tab.
