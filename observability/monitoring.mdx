Porter provides observability around your basic application metrics. Below are the metrics that Porter supports:

- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Network Usage
- Network Throughput (number of networking errors from NGINX)

All metrics are retained up to 30 days by default and are collected via [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) that runs inside your own cluster. Porter is responsible for the reliability of this prometheus instance and manages it on an ongoing basis.

While these metrics support basic use cases, for advanced options we recommend using a 3rd party addon such as DataDog, Mezmo, New Relic, or Cloudwatch.
Installing these addons is as simple as one click. You can find a list of 3rd party observability tools that Porter supports inside the **Addons** tab.
