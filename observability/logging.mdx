Porter retains your logs up to 7 days by default. 

You can perform basic search across your logs and navigate across different time periods.

All logs are stored exclusively inside your own infrastructure using [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) and does not get stored anywhere on Porter's system. Porter is responsible for the reliability of the Loki instance running on your cluster.
