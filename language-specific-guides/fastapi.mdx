# FastAPI

Deploying an application on Porter is simple and follows the same steps regardless of which framework/language you are
deploying, as long as your application is packaged as a container. 

This guide shows you how to containerize your FastAPI server with an example repository.

# Boilerplate Application

You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/porter-dev/fastapi-example) to get started.

This example repository contains a boilerplate FastAPI app. The main file contains:

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

# How to Deploy

## Create an account on Porter

Unlike other PaaS options, Porter deploys your applications to your own AWS account. Before deploying a FastAPI application you must set up your infrastructure on AWS first.

First, create an account on [Porter](https://dashboard.getporter.dev). Follow [this guide](/standard/getting-started/provisioning-on-aws) to create the necessary infrastructure on AWS.

## Deploying from the dashboard
Once your infrastructure has been provisioned on AWS, you can start deploying your FastAPI application. Take a look here for a more [detailed guide](https://docs.porter.run/standard/getting-started/deploy-overview).

1. Create a New Application on Porter.
2. Select the Git repository you have forked from the example repo.
3. Add a Web service to the application. There is no need to add a start command, because the `Dockerfile` in the example repository already has a command specified.
4. Click Deploy.

That's it! You should be able to see your FastAPI server on a Porter URL that ends with `onporter.run`. Verify that the application has been deployed by going to the `/docs` page on your application, which will show the auto-generated docs as below:
