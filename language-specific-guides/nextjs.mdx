# Next.js

Porter deploys your application to a cloud provider of your choice in a few clicks, whether that is AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. 
Just push your code to a Git repository and let Porter handle the rest from CI/CD to autoscaling.

This guide will walk you through the steps of deploying a NextJS app on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure via Porter.

We will be using this [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/porter-dev/nextjs-hello-world) as an example.

1. Make a fork of the [nextjs-hello-world](https://github.com/porter-dev/nextjs-hello-world) repository.
2. On Porter, create a new application from Git.
3. Select the forked repository and the branch you would like to deploy:

4. You can ignore all the other options and click "Deploy app" to create the application.

That's it! After a minute or two, your application should finish building and be deployed on Porter. All new commits pushed to your forked repository will automatically update your Next.js app.

You can verify your application is running as expected by navigating to the application's generated URL:

You should see the Next.js hello world page:
