# Next.js

Deploying a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application on Porter is extremely simple.

This guide will show you how to deploy the Next.js [hello-world](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/hello-world) example with just a few clicks:

1. Make a fork of the [nextjs-hello-world](https://github.com/porter-dev/nextjs-hello-world) repository.
2. On Porter, create a new application from Git.
3. Select the forked repository and the branch you would like to deploy:

4. You can ignore all the other options and click "Deploy app" to create the application.

That's it! After a minute or two, your application should finish building and be deployed on Porter. All new commits pushed to your forked repository will automatically update your Next.js app.

You can verify your application is running as expected by navigating to the application's generated URL:
