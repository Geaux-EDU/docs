# NodeJS

Porter deploys your application to a cloud provider of your choice in a few clicks, whether that is AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. 
Just push your code to a Git repository and let Porter handle the rest from CI/CD to autoscaling.

This guide will walk you through the steps of deploying a NodeJS app on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure via Porter.

# How to Deploy

## Create an account on Porter

Porter deploys your applications to your own AWS, GCP, or Azure account. To deploy a NodeJS application, you must first connect your cloud account to Porter.

First, create an account on [Porter](https://dashboard.getporter.dev). Follow [this guide](/standard/getting-started/provisioning-on-aws) to connect your AWS, GCP, or Azure account. 
Porter will create the necessary infrastructure in the cloud provider of your choice.

## Deploying from the dashboard

Once you've connected your AWS account, you can start deploying your application. Deploying your app on Porter is simple and follows identical steps regardless of which language and framework you use.
Take a look here for a more [detailed guide](https://docs.porter.run/standard/getting-started/deploy-overview).

1. Create a New Application on Porter.
2. Select the Git repository you would like to deploy.
3. Click Deploy.

That's it! Porter will automatically build your application into a container image, push it to your own container registry, then deploy it.

You will be able to see your app deployed on a vanity URL that ends with `onporter.run`.
