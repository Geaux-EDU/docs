# Django

Porter deploys your applications to a cloud provider of your choice in a few clicks, whether that is AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
Just push your code to a Git repository and let Porter handle the rest from CI/CD to autoscaling.

This guide will walk you through the steps of deploying a Django app on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure via Porter.

# How to Deploy

## Create an account on Porter

Porter deploys your applications to your own AWS, GCP, or Azure account. To deploy a Django application, you must first connect your cloud account to Porter.

First, create an account on [Porter](https://dashboard.getporter.dev). Follow [this guide](/standard/getting-started/provisioning-on-aws) to connect your AWS, GCP, or Azure account. 
Porter will create the necessary infrastructure in the cloud provider of your choice.

## Deploying from the dashboard

Once you've connected your AWS account, you can start deploying your Django application. Take a look here for a more [detailed guide](https://docs.porter.run/standard/getting-started/deploy-overview).

1. Create a New Application on Porter.
2. Select the Git repository you would like to deploy.
3. Click Deploy.

That's it! Porter will automatically build and deploy your application.

You will be able to see the example Django app deployed on a vanity URL that ends with `onporter.run`.
