_Preview Environments_ are isolated instances of your application used for testing purposes. You can configure Porter to create a preview environment for every new pull request made to your Github repository. There are three steps required to get preview environments working with your application:

* Make sure preview environments are enabled for your cluster
* Preview environments enabled for your desired Github repository
* A `preview.yaml` file at the root of your repository

Please read through the setup guide to start using Preview Environments.
