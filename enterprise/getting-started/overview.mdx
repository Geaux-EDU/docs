Designed for companies that want more visibility into their underlying Kubernetes cluster, 
Porter's Enterprise offering exposes the underlying details of the infrastructure to the user to a greater extent than Porter Standard, along with more
advanced features and namely the ability to deploy to multiple clusters.

With DevOps mode enabled, get a complete grasp of your underlying Kubernetes cluster and interface directly with Kubernetes objects. 
Porter Enterprise is available for companies whose resource usage exceeds 40 vCPU and 80 GB RAM **at no additional cost**. Learn more about our pricing model [here](https://porter.run/pricing).

We do not recommend this option for companies that want the simplest developer experience possible. If you truly don't want anything to do with DevOps or Kubernetes, you should head to the documentation for [Porter Standard](/standard/getting-started/overview).

This **Getting Started** guide will show you how to deploy your first application on Porter Enterprise.
