Porter lets you create and update applications using the CLI. By default, the CLI builds your application, pushes it to a Docker registry, and re-deploys your application on Porter. Note that these commands are used internally when you [deploy from Github](/enterprise/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github) or [use your own CI tools](/enterprise/deploying-applications/using-other-ci-tools).

<Card title="Prerequisites">
  * A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/overview))
  * The Porter CLI installed ([view installation instructions](/cli/installation)).
</Card>
