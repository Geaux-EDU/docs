title: "Environment Groups"

An environment group (or env group for short) is a set of environment variables that are meant to be reused across multiple applications. For example, if all web services require a shared set of API and database keys, this could form a web-service environment group with all of those keys as a shared configuration. In this guide, we will explain how to create and use environment groups.

<Info>
  Environment groups are stored in your own cluster as a Kubernetes Config Map
  or a Kubernetes Secret. The data will be visible to any users or services with
  access to your cluster, such as Porter.

## Creating and Using Environment Groups

Clicking the “New Env Group” button will open a modal where you can enter the name of the environment group and the environment variables that should be included in the group.
The limit for the name of an env group is 15 characters and you can add your environment variables by clicking the “Add Row button or batch upload them via a .env file

To create a secret environment variable, click on the lock icon next to the environment variable during creation of the environment variable:
