title: "Environment Groups"
---

An environment group (or env group for short) is a set of environment variables that are meant to be reused across multiple applications. For example, if all web services require a shared set of API and database keys, this could form a web-service environment group with all of those keys as a shared configuration. In this guide, we will explain how to create and use environment groups.

<Info>
  Environment groups are stored in your own cluster as a Kubernetes Config Map
  or a Kubernetes Secret. The data will be visible to any users or services with
  access to your cluster, such as Porter.

## Creating and Using Environment Groups

You can create a new environment group in the “Env Groups” tab on the dashboard.
