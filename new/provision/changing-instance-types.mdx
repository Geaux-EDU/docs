The following settings should be displayed:

- **Cluster Version** - the version of the underlying Kubernetes cluster.
- **Machine Type** - The underlying instance of the nodes that your applications are running on. The options here will vary per cloud provider.
- **Maximum number of nodes** - The maximum number of nodes that your cluster will autoscale to under high load.
- **Minumum number of nodes** - The minimum number of nodes that your cluster will autoscale to under low load.

4. Select the appropriate **Machine Type** from the dropdown, then scroll to the bottom of the page, and click `Provision`.

## FAQ

### Why does my cloud provider offer an instance that is not available on Porter?

If you have an instance type that you would like to use in mind, it may not be available in the same region as your cluster.
This happens frequently as each cloud provider releases new instances on a phased basis, region by region.

Porter extensively tests the compatibility of instance types across a wide range of cluster and application configurations.
Whilst the instance types that are available on Porter suit the most common needs of our users, we will be happy to add requested instance types for any cloud provider.
Message us from the dashboard through the chat bot, or send us an email at support@porter.run.

### How much will my instance type cost?

The specific instance types that are available for each cloud provider, along with their pricing can be found on their docs at the links below
