An application rollback may be necessary if a change was deployed that is not desired. Luckily, it is easy to rollback your application to the last successful version.

In the **Activity** tab of your application, navigate to the **Deploy** event you wish to rollback to, and click the revert button:

![Rollback](/images/deploying-applications/rollback.png)

Note that only successful deployments are able to be rolled back to.
