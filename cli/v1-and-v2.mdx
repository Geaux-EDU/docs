title: "v1 and v2"
---

There are two versions of the CLI that are currently supported by Porter. All projects that were created after May 1st, 2023 will be using the v2 CLI. All projects created before then will be using the v1 CLI.

We will be deprecating the v1 CLI on June 31st, 2024. For all our existing users, you will receive an email from us to ensure that this deprecation will not cause any disruption in your current Porter setup before the deprecation date.

Please consult the appropriate command reference depending on the CLI version you are using.
